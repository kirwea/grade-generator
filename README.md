Week 1 Code Challenge
Three Challenges
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem) Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem) Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem) (index.js)
The user is inputs their marks in the program and the program will define their Grade. The input should between be between numbers 0 and 100.

Then grade are in the following order: A is any marks greater than 79 B is any marks greater or eual to 60 and less than or equal to 79 C is any marks greater than 49 and less than or equal to 59 D is any marks greater than 39 and less than 49 E is any marks less than 40

The program returns the grade of a student based on their input marks.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
This program takes the speed of a car, and ff the speed is less than 70, it print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit of 70, it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. For example if the speed is 80, it prints: “Points: 2” since it has exceeded the speed limit by 5 twice. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended!!”. The greatest challenge I faced here was how to arrive at the demerit points but through research, I was able to arrive to a failry good implementation.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
This program calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits then removing the standard deductions. The program Calculates the paye tax, NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and outputs the net salary.
